# Basic Calculator ðŸ”¢

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Division, and Multiplication. Built using `switch-case` in Java to practice conditional logic and user input handling.

## Motivation

Part of my Java Mini Lab series â€” this calculator helped me get comfortable with control flow (`switch`), ternary operations, and user-driven input logic.

## Features

- Performs 2-digit arithmetic operations
- Supports:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction (absolute difference)
  - Division (with zero-check)
  - Multiplication
- Uses `switch-case` for cleaner branching logic
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
