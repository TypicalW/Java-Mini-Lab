# Palindrome Checker 
Palindromes are words or phrases that read the same forward and backward — like `madam` or `racecar`. This project focuses on identifying whether a given input string is a palindrome using simple logic and control structures in Java.

## Motivation

This was one of my first logical scripts while revisiting core Java concepts. The goal was to explore `Scanner`, conditionals, loops, and string operations — while keeping the logic readable and the structure beginner-friendly.

## Features

- Takes user input from the terminal
- Compares characters from both ends of the string
- Outputs whether the string is a palindrome
- Can be easily extended to support case-insensitivity or ignore symbols/spaces

##  Build Status

Completed 
Served as a solid refresh of basic Java syntax, especially working with character manipulation and loop control.
