# Java Mini Lab

This repository contains a collection of small Java-based projects created for academic learning and hands-on practice. Each project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as user input, control structures, and conditional logic.

## Projects

### 1. Basic Calculator

A simple calculator built in Java using switch-case statements.

**Features:**
- Performs basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Accepts two operands and handles divide-by-zero cases
- User-friendly prompts with input validation

**Directory:** `/Basic-Calculator`

### 2. Palindrome Checker

A Java program to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

**Features:**
- Takes a string input from the user
- Uses two-pointer logic to check if the input is the same forward and backward
- Efficient and beginner-friendly implementation

**Directory:** `/PalindromeChecker`

### 3. Day Finder

A Java console application that determines the day of the week for any given valid date using Zellerâ€™s Congruence algorithm.

**Features:**
- Accepts user input for day, month, and year
- Validates leap years and correct number of days in each month
- Uses mathematical logic to compute the weekday
- Outputs the correct day of the week (e.g., "Monday", "Saturday")
